# nokey - Access APIs without a Key

nokey is a Python package designed to provide easy access to various APIs that do not require an API key for authentication. This project aims to simplify the process of interacting with different APIs by offering a unified interface for accessing them, all within a single Python package.

## Features

- Access a growing collection of keyless APIs conveniently from one place.
- Organized into submodules based on categories such as country information, finance, geolocation, spaceflight, education, food, random data, jokes, animals, science, and weather, developer tools, language, and games.
- Easily installable via pip, making it accessible to all Python developers.

## Installation

You can install the module using pip:

```
pip install nokey
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use one of the APIs to access a random dog image:

```python
from nokey.animals import dog_api

# Initialize the DogAPI object
dog = dog_api.DogAPI()

# Get a random dog image URL
dog_image_url = dog.get_random_dog_image()

# Print the URL
print(dog_image_url)
```

Also, to print out a list of the APIs supported by nokey, simply run the following script:

```python
from nokey.helperFuncs.get_api_list import get_api_list

api_list = get_api_list()

print(api_list)
```

Each API class has an "about" attribute that returns a short description of the API. To get the URL for the API documentation of any API, simply call the get_docs_url() method for the API class.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to expand the range of APIs available in nokey. Whether you want to add a new submodule or enhance an existing one, your contributions are valuable. To contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
